## Motivation

The 20 Billion dollar hair care industry has the opportunity to evolve and differentiate to meet the needs of today’s high-tech, on-the-move users. Hair salons that appeal to these users must satisfy them by offering a differentiating level of service. With this project, we have attempted to address this challenge by developing a hairstyle recommendation system that identifies the user’s face shape and recommends the most flattering hairstyle that celebrities with similar face shape have used.

## Introduction
 
Choosing the perfect hairstyle can be a daunting task, but with our system, uses can find the ideal hairstyle that suits their face shape, hair texture, and personal style. Our recommendation system utilizes advanced algorithms, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to analyze the user's facial features and provide them with personalized hairstyle recommendations.

Whether the user is looking for a new look, a style for a special occasion, or simply seeking some inspiration, our system can help the user to decide the best hair-style for them. Our database features a vast array of hairstyle options, including trendy cuts, classic styles, and everything in between.

With our easy-to-use interface, a user can simple click and upload a photo and receive personalized recommendations within minutes. Plus, our system also provides helpful tips and tricks for styling and maintaining the new cut.

Say goodbye to bad hair-styles and say hello to fabulous hair-styles with our Hair-Style Recommendation System!

It can also be helpful for those who may not have access to professional hair-styling services or who prefer to experiment with new looks on their own.

## Project Scope

The system utilizes advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyze user inputs and face shape to provide suggestions for hairstyles that are most likely suited to their individual needs and preferences.

The system includes a vast database of hairstyle options, ranging from trendy and modern cuts to classic and timeless styles used by prominent celebrities. Users can upload a photo of themselves and receive personalized recommendations within minutes, along with helpful tips and tricks for styling and maintaining their new hairstyle.

While our system can be a valuable resource for individuals seeking inspiration and guidance for their hair, it does not provide professional hair styling services or recommendations for hair treatments or products.
